This repository includes the results of a study conducted as a combined final project for two courses on the ability of explanations to impact the trust and acceptance of decisions made by algorithms.

### ExplainabilityStudy

This file is included in both Rmd and PDF format. This contains the results and analysis of the final survey. It references the file Explainability_Study_legacy_export.csv, which is the data exported from the Qualtrics survey. It is included as Appendix A in the final report.

### ExplainabilityPilot

This file is included as both an Rmd and PDF file. This contains the results and analysis of a pilot study conducted to determine which explanations we should employ in the main study. It is included as Appendix B in the final report.

### Explainability Study Qualtrics Export

This is an automated export from Qualtrics that documents all of the questions included in the survey. Explainability_Study.docx is also a Qualtrics export in Word format with some additional features like question numbers and survey flow. It is included as Appendix C in the final report.
